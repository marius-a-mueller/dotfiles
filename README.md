# Dotfiles

## Intro

Hi, here you can see my dotfiles. They are changing all the time and are of course customized to my taste but maybe you can find some ideas for your own config.

## Install

At the moment I have to ways to use these dotfiles. One way is to just clone to repo into `.config` and the other is to use another folder and then use Nix to configure my system and dotfiles.
